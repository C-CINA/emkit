  "body": "### Welcome to emkit!\r\nemkit is a ready to use fast and optimised templated C++ toolkit for developers in the field of Electron Microscopy\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- Easy to install and extend\r\n- Easy to understand, intuitional, modular in structure\r\n- Defines classes and object that are typically used in the field\r\n- Contains methods, algorithms, file I/O and other basic operations\r\n- Optimised to handle big amount of data including high performance computing counterparts built in\r\n\r\n### Components\r\nThe library was designed and implemented in C++ with C++11 standards and practices. The library contains templated classes which can be adopted to the specific requirements.\r\n\r\n#### Classes/Objects:\r\n- Tensor: A class which can store data of any kind including native objects like double, float, int, bool, or any user defined class in arbitrary n dimensions. This class also has an associated iterator which helps to iterate though all the indices and the data stored in a linear way. Objects like images, particles, Fourier images, volumes, stacks, stack of stacks, atomic models can be easily developed using this class.\r\n- Sparse Tensor: In some cases the images have a lot of zeros, for example, masks, diffraction images, etc. In these cases it is not efficient to store them using the full objects. The toolkit introduces a sparse representation of the images. Using this class one can store an 8,000 X 8,000 pixel images (which would usually take 256 MB space) to a maximum space of 32 KB.\r\n- Table: Tables occur in files, for example, a reflection file which gives the amplitude and phase on different miller indices or an atomic coordinate file which gives a list of coordinates mapped to the atom at that location. This class provides manipulations like changing a column, reducing a column, etc. on these kind of files.\r\nOther general purpose classes like Strings, Files etc.\r\n\r\n#### Methods\r\n- File Input/Output: The toolkit can read and write commonly used image file formats including mrc, mtz, map,  hkl.\r\n- Fourier transforms: Fourier transforms are integral part of image processing in cryo-EM. API is provided using FFTW library to easily carry out Fourier transforms and convert one tensor to the other.\r\n- Class converters: Converts the representation of one object to the other.\r\nBasic image processing algorithms: Masking, sectioning, slicing, erosion, dilation, correlation etc. are provided\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nNikhil Biyani (@nikhilbiyani)\r\n\r\n",
